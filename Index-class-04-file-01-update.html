					<p> The sporty Jaguar MK II was built from 1959 to 1967 and is prized for its elegance, performance and luxury. It had advanced technology and, above all, powerful in-line six-cylinder engines. The car for sale was delivered new in Switzerland in the very rare color "opalescent bronze". The last owner acquired the car in 1988 and restored it down to the last screw from 2000-2002. Great importance was attached to originality and perfect work was carried out down to the smallest detail. </p>
